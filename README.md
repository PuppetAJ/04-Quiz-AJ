# Code Quiz Challenge

## Contents
This is Adrian Jimenez's Code quiz challenge submission. 

To start this project I took what I knew of the HTML DOM API to start mapping out what I wanted the page to look like. I laid out the initial html, tested styles through trial and error, and then would use javascript to generate the content within separate functions. I added the content of each quiz question into an array of objects, allowing me to create a function responsible for constructing every question onto the page as opposed to having a separate function for every question I wanted. Once I got the questions and logic to a place that was satisfactory, I created functions to save and load high scores from the user into local storage, allowing the high scores to persist past the session. Finally, I tweaked some styles, organized my code and added media queries to make sure the page was responsive.
